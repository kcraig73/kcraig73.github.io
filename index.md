## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🍎 School Lunch Menu Integration (Home Assistant + PDF Parsing)
Created a custom Home Assistant integration that parses manually downloaded school lunch PDFs to display daily menu items via voice (TTS) and dashboard widgets.  
- Recognizes theme days (e.g., *Taco Tuesday*) and holidays  
- Filters and classifies entrees vs. sides  
- Automatically skips weekends and adjusts for school breaks  
- TTS announcement via Alexa or Node-RED automations

### 🎥 Frigate NVR – Optimized Configuration
Designed and tested a high-efficiency configuration for Frigate NVR using dual EdgeTPUs and GPU-accelerated decoding with go2rtc and NVIDIA.  
- Organized stream structure for high performance (detect vs record)  
- Fine-tuned camera prioritization and performance balancing  
- Enabled reliable timelapse capture for time-sensitive observation (e.g., *Butterfly Cam*)
